## Proposal


### Domain Background


In the case of rising wages, there are still many Taiwan young people who simply canâ€™t afford to buy a house.(Taiwan house price problem is hot!) Otherwise, they have to bear 20 or 30 years of mortgages. After the government publishes maps of various disaster potentials, it is feared that they will have to lose money. However, "experts" say that although the process of buying a house may not necessarily make money, the process may still be very painful. It is necessary to "require the daily necessities", and it is necessary to buy one when people are young as soon as possible.


### Problem Statement


Many people seeing at the house and buy a house. They all have a question in their minds: "What is the reasonable price of a house?" When we really like a house, what price we want to pay will not be too high. In Taiwan, real estate information is not so easily to get, people always "heard" from the housing agency but they just want you pay for more agency fees, so how to pay for reasonable price is a problem which could solved by machine learning. 


### Datasets and Inputs


In order to practice the housing price problem, I download the data from Kaggle. The training data contains 80 features and data set split as two parts: 1460 training data(include some blank entry, so data preprocess is needed.) and 1459 test data. 

### Solution Statement

Consider the nearest house price would be a reasonable solution. KNN the strait way which predict by grouping the nearest data point. House price just easily suit the algorithm. In the same street or block or building, there house price would be closed in unit cost, or maybe combine the floor number or some factors. so decision tree may also be a good choice of prediction for the multi level feature combination to the house price problem. 

### Benchmark Model

In my first thought, "location, location, location" is the golden rule in many ways of real estate, so the neighborhood house price of the same location is most important feature of house price prediction model. If I have house price of up/down floor then I can predict the price must be in the range of up/down floor.
### Evaluation Metrics

- Final sales price is the final index of this problem, when a new or old house is going to be sold, the sale price is the first and only thing most people care, so the price is a reasonable way to evaluate the model.
- Unit price is also the objective index, so many people could predict total house price by easily times floor size and unit price price.
- parking lot are usually an issue of house price in the city, parking lot unit price sometimes higher than floor unit price.
Final price = (Floor space) x (unit price) + (parking lot price) 

### Project Design

The first step is downloading the dataset from anywhere like Kaggle or other pipeline. Review the dataset and simply take few of this dataset to try the models of previously mentioned (Average the neighborhood, KNN, Decision tree). Preprocessing the dataset is always needed, to remove the uncompleted data or normalize dataset. Trining model with training data and do the cross validation to prevent overfitting. Test the model with new data (test data) to verify the model is workable or not. Review the difference between prediction result and real result to optimize the model.
